## Teaching Resources

This repository is designed to gather the code I wrote as a teaching assistant (TA) for students to implement various functions. The directory below is periodically updated to provide a quick index to the content stored in this repository.

- **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**: Explaining the principles and functions of the Bag-of-Words model and the TF-IDF method, I demonstrated how to apply them when processing text data. Additionally, I also introduced two distinct approaches for preprocessing English and Chinese corpora. -> [_BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb) for English corpora and [_BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb) for Chinese corpora

- **Random Digit Search (RDS)**: Following the approach of Zhu et al. [(2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439310382512), an estimation is made for the actual user population of NetEase Cloud Music. -> [_music163_RDS.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/music163_RDS.ipynb)

## Teaching Resources

This repository is designed to gather the code I wrote as a teaching assistant (TA) for students to implement various functions. The directory below is periodically updated to provide a quick index to the content stored in this repository.

- **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**: Explain the principles and functions of the Bag-of-Words model and TF-IDF method, and demonstrate how to apply them when processing text data. -> [_BoW_Tfidf.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/music163_RDS.ipynb)

- **Random Digit Search (RDS)**: Following the approach of Zhu et al. [(2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439310382512), an estimation is made for the actual user population of NetEase Cloud Music. -> _music163_RDS.ipynb_
